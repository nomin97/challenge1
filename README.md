# Code Refractor Challenge 1: Horiseon

## Description
This was created to practice our html and css skills. We were tasked with cleaning up the html and css to be semantic and be read in a logical and concise structure. I also add alternative captions to the image so that in the event the page does not load, the user still has an idea of what is supposed to be there. Older html files tend to have a lot of div, so cleaning it up and creating specific seperate semantic elements allows future editors to the code to be able to read it. Through this project, I also ran into issues with git, so I learned that creating a clean repository is essential for a smooth process, especially as we start collaborating on other projects. This goes along with our overall project, laying down a clear html and css structure makes for a smoother process.
